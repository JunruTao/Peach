## Documentation Tasks and Notes
- :yellow_square: **Documentation Tools**
    - [x] --- date-time based changeLogs auto generator. create new changeLog files according to the date, and append new changes to that date's changeLog with timestamps. <sup>(py, shell)</sup>
    - [x] --- automatically open `code` after the shell execution. open up the change log file that needed to be editied.
    - [x] --- Auto append sub change-logs to a _main_ change-log, as `Markdown/html hyperlinks`.
    (maybe override the same file each time)

    - [x] --- split change log into months, and format main change log into sub sections.
