### :electric_plug: Building install both dev/install version of package/scripts

### :electric_plug: Finished install script/added package content
> Time: 09:12:09 | Author: Junru Tao
* Optimised the build workflow:
    1. added `houdini_util.py` in the `${PEACH}/config/scripts`, the changes only needed to be made here
    2. in `cmake`, installing will copy this file in both **install** and **dev**
    3. in `dev_`, it's been clustered as a __`util_x`__ python module, that ignored by git and less easier to be accidentally edited while working on the dev level scripts.
