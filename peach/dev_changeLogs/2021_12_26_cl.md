### :electric_plug: Edit On ReadMe and Diagram: Houdini Package.
> Time: 01:32:14 | Author: Junru Tao

Right after Christmas :christmas_tree:, I have digged a bit more into the houdini documentation. So I suspect the best way of boostrapping houdini, is using a python script then loading the __`Houdini Package JSON`__. it will come in handy as I will have all the path configurations, user, project, plug-in related stuff.
