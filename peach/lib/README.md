- [x] --- Create first Houdini python package and install it.
- [x] --- <s>add a post python script, file all the python files,
    replace the comment template with the correct template.
  - `Method #1`
  - make a global template.
  - cmake configure that file and dump as temp file.
  - after cmake, run python command and configure those files.
  - `Method #2`
  - make the all comments replaceable, python command file modify 
  all the files inplace.
- [x] ---  all the init scripts, shell scripts in `/config` folder should
be configured using configure file in cmake as well. </s> `(Decided not doing this way)`
